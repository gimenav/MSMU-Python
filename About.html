            <h1><u>About Teacher</u></h1>
            <p class="line"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/irmaravkic" target="_blank">Irma Ravkic</a> is an assistant professor at Mount Saint Mary's University, and is part of the Computer Science department at the Mount. A little bit about professor Ravkic, is that she was born in Bosnia & Herzegovina, and has degrees in both Electrical Engineering and Artificial Intelligence. In addition, Ravkic is an intelligent, artistic, adventurous, witty, resilient and down to earth person, who is always willing to help. Ravkic is someone who not only teaches students Computer Science, and helps students to sharpen their problem solving and analytical skills. But someone who pushes students to be the best they can be.  </p>
            <br>
            <p>The Mount is so very lucky to have her! With her help, along with the Computer Science program at the Mount, various female students have had an opportunity to learn and explore the world of Computer Science. Their contribution has empowered women, by inspiring them to strive in the STEM field and giving them the tools to succeed in it.</p>

                <p>This introduction to computer science, developed by Google and their university partners, emphasizes problem solving and data analysis skills along with computer programming skills. Using Python, you will learn design, implementation, testing, and analysis of algorithms and programs. And within the context of programming, you will learn to formulate problems, think creatively about solutions, and express those solutions clearly and accurately. Problems will be chosen from real-world examples such as graphics, image processing, cryptography, data analysis, astronomy, video games, and environmental simulation. Furthermore, you will use robots to see how they react to the code you wrote for them.</p>

                <h1><u>What is this website for?</u></h1>
                <p> **This website was created in order to give prospective students an overview of what they will learn in this course. It is also a friendly guide to help students try to understand some of the topics that are covered in the course. **</p>
                <br>
                <p> As the creator of this website, and a fellow Mount student who took this course, I  know how rewarding, yet challenging programming can be. So I wanted to help other students understand the Python concepts, that I and hopeful YOU learn in this class. My goal is for students to not get frustrated and discouraged and quit, or think that they don't belong in this field. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Because I know that when I first started this course, I was intimidaed by Computer Science, just like other students are too. I was worried that I was going to struggle and fail this class, because I struggle with math and felt that I wasn't smart enough to do programming. But I was completely wrong, I was smart enough to learn and create cool projects wiht programming. Though, math is essential period, but you can still learn to program. All you got to do is practice programming frequently(or daily), be constantly looking for the answers to your problems, ask for help(there are many online forums), be persistent and don't give up! If you do this, then you will find that you might really like Computer Science and want to learn more! </p>
