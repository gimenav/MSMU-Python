            <h1><u>Chapter 7: Iteration</u></h1>
            <h4><b>What is an iteration?</b></h4>
            <p>An <u>iteration</u> is used to repeat a task. Iterations have different loops, such as the "for loop" and the "while loop". </p>
            <h4><b>What is the for loop?</b></h4>
            <p> The <u>for loop</u> is used to loop through a sequence, such as strings, lists, tuples and dictionaries. To initiate the for loop, the programmer needs to: </p>
                <ol>
                 <li>Type "for"(initiates the for loop)</li> 
                 <li>Type the variable that takes the value of each item that is being iterated, called the iterator variable. This can be named "i" or another name.</li>  
                <li>The programmer needs to type "in"  and then the sequence's name, in order to tell the computer what sequence to iterate over.</li>
                </ol>
                 <img src="for.png" alt="" class="for-img">
            <p>For loop with strings.</p>
            <img src="for2.png" alt="" class="for2-img">
            <p><u>Result:</u></p>
            <img src="for3.png" alt="" class="for3-img">
            <p>For loop with lists.</p>
            <img src="for4.png" alt="" class="for4-img">
            <h4><b>What is the range function?</b></h4>
            <p>The <u>range</u> function is used to return a sequence of numbers, which depends on the numbers inside the range function. In order to start the range function, the programmer needs to begin by typing "range()"; inside the parentheses, they can type one number, like 5. This will generate: 0,1,2,3,4. </p>
                <ul>
               <li>Remember that the range function starts to count from 0, which is the first number.</li> 
                </ul>
                <img src="forx.png" alt="" class="forx-img">
            <p>Now, if they want to generate numbers between 5 and 10. Then: </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The first number inside the range function, will be the starting point(states what number to start at), which in this case will be 5.</li>
                    <li> Type a comma to separate both numbers</li>
                    <li>Type endpoint number(is the number that the range function stops before reaching), which in this case will be 11.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Why is it this way?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Well, Python starts it's countdown with the startpoint number, and the difference between 5 and 11 is 6, so Python counts these six numbers: "5,6,7,8,9,10".</li>
                </ul>
            <img src="range.png" alt="" class="range-img">
            <p>In addition, this function can  be used to perform a task repeatedly, again depending on the numbers inside the range function.</p>
            <img src="for5.png" alt="" class="for5-img">
            <h4><b>What is the accumulator pattern?</b></h4>
            <p>The <u>accumulator pattern</u> is a very useful pattern tool, which can be used to add, subtract or multiply the numbers in a list. It can either increment or decrement the total value of the list of numbers in the sequence.</p>
            <p>The way to use the accumulator pattern is to: </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Start with the accumulator variable, which states what number to start with, such as 0(this variable is stated before the for loop). </li>
                    <li>Initiate for loop, which iterates through the sequence.</li>
                    <li>The accumulator variable starts with the original value of 0, and each time it updates the accumulator variable by adding, subtracting, or multiplying each time it iterates through a number from the list.</li>
                </ol>
            <img src="accum.png" alt="" class="accum-img">
            <h4><b>How to use the for loop for indexing?</b></h4>
            <p>Indexing in a for loop can be done in lists, strings, dictionaries and other types of sequences. To start indexing in a for loop: </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Create a sequence</li>
                    <li>Type a for loop that uses the range function, with either the amount of items in the sequence or less than the total number of items.</li>
                    <li>Print the iterator variable, with a comma next to it, and lastly the name of the sequence/variable name, square brackets next to it, and inside the brackets the variable name.</li>
                </ol>
            <p>But why print that?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Well, first the iterator variable is printed because it generates the numbers that are in the range function, and the numbers that will be used to enumerate/index the items in the sequence.</li>
                    <li>The variable name[iterator variable] is printed, because it tells Python to assign every number in the range function that is being iterated, to put those in order of the items in the sequence.</li>
                </ul>
