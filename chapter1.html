                <h1><u>Chapter 1: Introduction</u></h1>
                <h4><b>What is Programming?</b></h4>
                <p><u>Programming</u> is the process of taking an algorithm and encoding it into a notation, a programming language, so that it can be executed by a computer. In other words, is a set of instructions send to be translated(by a compiler) into the language that the computer/machine understands, so it can be executed. Although many programming languages and many different types of computers exist, the important first step is the need to have the solution. Without an algorithm there can be no program.</p>
                <h4><b>What is an algorithm?</b></h4>
                <p>It is a step by step set of instructions used to solve a problem. For example, if you wanted to raise money to help people who live below the poverty line in Latin America, you need algorithms to figure out both the numbers of people that live in those conditions and how much money you need to raise.</p>
                <h4><b>High level languages vs. Low level languages</b></h4>
                <p><u>High level languages</u> are programming languages that are easier to write, read, and be understood by humans. Plus, it is portable, which means that it works in different computers. However, since these languages are closer to the languages that we speak and write, they need to be processed and translated in the language that the computer understands. Some high level languages include: Python, C++ and Java.</p>
                <br>
                <p><u>Low level languages</u> are easier to be interpreted by computers than by humans. These languages sometimes have letters and numbers, though others only consist of numbers. The computer processes the code faster, because the computer understands these languages, and doesn't need to be translated, like high level languages do. Some low level languages include: Assembly Language and Machine Code.</p>
                <h4><b>What is a Program?</b></h4>
                <p>A set of instructions that tells the computer to perform a computation. A computation can be adding two numbers together or finding out the square root of a number. Example:</p>

                <h4><b>What is a token?</b></h4>
                <p>A <u>token</u> is the smallest individual unit in programming. There are four different types of token:</p>
                    <ul class="token">
                        <li>Keywords: These are a set of words that have a specific meaning or function in Python. </li>
                        <ul class="keywords">
                            <li>Example: if, import, while, not, for, else, and or.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Identifiers: Are names that the user assigns to entities, such as variables, functions, classes, modules or other objects. </li>
                            <li> These are the requirements to keep in mind, while creating an identifier:</li> 
                        <ul class="identify">
                            <li>It has to start with a letter or an underscore (_), not with a number or a symbol.</li>
                            <li>Identifiers can not have punctuation, @, % or the $ symbol.</li>
                            <li>Python is case sensitive, so if your identifier has an uppercase, and you call it with all lowercase, it would give you an error. </li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Literals: Is defined by data given to variables or constant. A couple of literal types include:</li>
                            <ul class="literal">
                                <li>
                                    Numerical Literals: Unchangeable numerical types, like integers, floats and complexes.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    String Literals: A set of characters inside quotation marks.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <ul class="operator">
                                <li>Operators:are special symbols used for arithmetic or logical computations.</li>
                            </ul>
                    </ul>
